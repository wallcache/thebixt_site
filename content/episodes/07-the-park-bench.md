Tom had a bench. Not officially his, of course—it belonged to the council and to the memory of someone named Margaret who'd loved this spot. But he'd been coming here for three years now, most Sunday mornings, and it felt like ownership.

The bench sat on the edge of Hampstead Heath, overlooking the city. On clear days, you could see the Shard, the Gherkin, all those buildings that made London look like the future.

'Thought I'd find you here.'

Felix stood nearby, holding a paper bag. 'Almond croissant. Your favourite.'

They sat together, watching the city wake up, and Felix told Tom he was thinking of leaving the agency. Tom told Felix about the song he couldn't finish.

'So we're both hiding,' Felix said.

'Maybe. Or maybe we're just figuring things out.'

Sometimes the best conversations happen on benches, overlooking cities, with pastries and time.
