The girls were queuing when the text came through.

Mags, Bea and Zella had all been laughing moments before. But as Bea pulled out the vibrating culprit, casting her eyes to the fresh message on screen, laughter suddenly felt like a very distant concept, feeling the floor fall away from her.

Zella reached for a crumbling Bea as Mags started to pass her a bottle of water.

'You don't have an ounce of colour, Bea' G gasped.

'What's happened?' Asked Zella's furrowed brow.

Suddenly Bea's saliva felt like she'd just swallowed a glass of olive oil, as she tried to form the words that had been put in a single digitalised line.

Finding the strength to turn the phone around for her friends to read, Bea thought about the orchid Baz had given her, sitting by the window that she'd failed to save from wilting, just like how Baz had failed to save her relationship it seemed.

Gathered around Bea's still lit phone, Mags and Zella read: 'I think you've been sleeping with my boyfriend, would you meet me for a coffee? x'
