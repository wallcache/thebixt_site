He was sitting there when Bea and her long legs arrived.

In preparation for this meeting, Bea had selectively bought herself the ultimate weapon: a new handbag, a copy of the FT Weekender and a portable charger for listening to Sheer Luxe's latest podcast for a tube journey distraction until she reached the safety haven of home, aka Holland Park.

'Birdie,' Baz said with an attempted smile, jumping up at her arrival.

He went to double-kiss her, but Bea made a point of pulling out her chair and sitting pointedly without his aid.

'I'm here,' Bea said, reaching out for her already waiting flat white with one spoon of cinnamon and one spoon of chocolate sitting on top.

Baz looked flustered, his usually perfectly laundered white shirt, a little ruffled. Creasing around the collar, Bea noted.

'Birdie, had I known she would have messaged you! I would have -'

Birdie rolled her eyes and began to stand. She already knew this tone and couldn't be bothered today.

'Find me when you're ready to apologise.' Bea said, reaching for her handbag again. 'We had an agreement, Baz. And you broke it.'

As Baz opened his mouth to defend himself, Bea cut in,

'Writing Love letters was simply off the table, Basil. We agreed.' And just like that, as quickly as it had started, the conversation was over. Bea began walking away, looking back at her outstretched chair. She looked Baz in the eye to add 'I saw them. Over Coffee. With her.' Leaving Baz opened mouth and speechless, Bea's raised eyebrow and new Chanel bag left the bar.
