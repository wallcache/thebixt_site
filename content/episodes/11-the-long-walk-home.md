It was Tom's idea to walk. 'The night bus will take forever anyway,' he said, breath visible in the cold November air. 'And I need to think.'

So they walked—Tom and Felix—from a gig in Brixton all the way back to Holloway. Five miles of London at 1am, through Stockwell and Vauxhall, across the river at Lambeth Bridge, up through Westminster and into the quiet streets of King's Cross.

For the first hour, they didn't talk much. Just walked, hands shoved in pockets, passing shuttered shops and late-night kebab places glowing like lanterns in the dark.

'The gig was good,' Felix offered eventually. They'd been to see an old university friend play at some basement venue, all exposed brick and expensive craft beer.

'Yeah.' Tom kicked a pebble along the pavement. 'Made me think, though. About all the things I said I'd do by thirty.'

'You're not thirty yet.'

'Eleven months.'

They crossed the river in silence, the Thames black and glittering beneath them. A night jogger passed. A taxi honked somewhere in the distance.

'I wrote a song last week,' Tom said suddenly. 'First one in months. It's probably terrible.'

'Play it for us sometime.'

'Maybe.' He paused. 'What if I'm not good enough? What if I've been kidding myself this whole time, and I'm just... average?'

Felix thought about his own doubts—the pitch he'd fumbled last Tuesday, the promotion he'd stopped wanting, the growing feeling that his life was a well-decorated waiting room.

'I think everyone feels that way,' he said finally. 'I think the trick is to do it anyway.'

They stopped at an all-night café near King's Cross, the kind with fluorescent lights and laminated menus and chips that came in styrofoam containers. They ordered tea and toast and sat by the window watching the occasional taxi drift past.

'Thanks for walking with me,' Tom said.

'Thanks for asking.'

By the time they parted ways at Holloway Road, the sky was starting to lighten at the edges. Felix's feet ached. He felt strangely peaceful.

Sometimes the longest way home is exactly what you need.
