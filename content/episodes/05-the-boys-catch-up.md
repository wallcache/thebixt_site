Archie threw his empty packet of crisps towards a nearby bin. It missed, and he trudged after it, quickly slam-dunking it inside without missing a beat in the boys' weekly catch-up.

'What about the other girl?' Archie mused.

'Who?' Max asked. 'Oh, Mary! Taking her for a frittata next week.'

'A frittata?!' Baz choked back laughter.

'Hey, we didn't mock you when you thought your racing team jackets should be sponsored by Greta Thunberg.'

'That —' Baz tried, but Archie wasn't finished slapping him on the back as his laughter had turned into choking on air.

'No, no — trust me. Nothing says come and take your boots off at my house like a frittata reservation the next day.' Max claimed confidently.

'Right, well, let us know how that goes, Maxy boy,' Archie concluded, ever the loyal friend.
