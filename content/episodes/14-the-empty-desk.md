Felix woke up at 9:47am on a Tuesday and felt nothing. No alarm, no panic, no rush to check emails before his feet hit the floor. Just silence and the pale winter light filtering through his bedroom curtains in Finsbury Park.

It had been three weeks since he'd walked out of the agency. Three weeks of mornings that belonged entirely to him. He still wasn't sure what to do with them.

He made coffee slowly, grinding the beans by hand—something he'd bought the equipment for years ago but never had time to use. The ritual of it felt almost sacred. Measure, grind, pour, wait.

His phone buzzed. Maya: 'Breakfast at the café on Stroud Green Road? I'm between meetings.'

Twenty minutes later, he was sitting across from her at a window table, watching condensation roll down the glass. The café smelled of bacon and strong tea, and Radio 2 played softly from somewhere in the kitchen.

'You look different,' Maya said, studying him over her flat white. 'Rested. It's weird.'

'I slept until nearly ten.' Felix shook his head. 'I don't think I've done that since university.'

'And? How does it feel? The freedom?'

Felix thought about it. About the strange guilt that still crept in around 6pm when he wasn't answering emails. About the way his identity had been so tangled up in being busy, being needed, being exhausted.

'Terrifying,' he admitted. 'But also—I made bread yesterday. Actual bread. From scratch. It took four hours and it was slightly burnt and it was the best thing I've eaten in months.'

Maya smiled. 'The Felix I met five years ago would have ordered that bread on Deliveroo and eaten it while responding to Slack messages.'

'The Felix you met five years ago was an idiot.'

They ordered—scrambled eggs for him, avocado toast for her—and talked about nothing and everything. About Tom's new song, about Liv's freelance projects, about whether Felix should learn pottery or finally read all those books on his shelf.

'You don't have to figure it all out immediately,' Maya said as they split the bill. 'That's sort of the whole point.'

Walking home through the park, Felix noticed things he'd missed for years. The way the light hit the Victorian terraces. A dog chasing pigeons. An old man feeding squirrels from a paper bag.

He had nowhere to be. And for the first time, that felt like a gift.
