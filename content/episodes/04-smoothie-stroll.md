'They've got my heart on a string, G!'

The two best of friends were on a smoothie stroll from 9 Saville Row to Battersea Park, the clouds a decorative canopy and the only witnesses to their conversation.

'Ok — and when did you hear from them last?' G tried, supportively.

'Mmmm, well, we went for dinner last Thursday.'

'It's Sunday, Flick! Text them!'

'But is 11:00 a good time to send a text?'

'Flick! Send the text. If you want them to be the mother of your children one day, they're going to have to be a bit more robust than the timing of a text.'

'It's a delicate —'

But G was saved from further coaxing as Flick's work phone — aka her only mobile — started to ring.

G nodded as Flick opened her mouth again to say she needed to run. Embracing quickly, Flick began phone already pressed to her ear, walking towards the park's exit, heading for the tube.

'This is your year — don't let them call the shots...' G called after the award-winning tech entrepreneur.
