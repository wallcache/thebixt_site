Tom hadn't crossed the Thames in three weeks. It wasn't intentional—life just kept him north. But today, Liv had insisted.

'Peckham,' she'd texted. 'New place. Trust me.'

So here he was, emerging from Peckham Rye station into the chaos of Rye Lane. The market stalls spilled onto the pavement, selling everything from plantains to vintage leather jackets. A man played steel drums outside the station, and for a moment, Tom just stood there, letting the sound wash over him.

He found Liv at a tiny café wedged between a nail salon and a West African grocery. She was already seated by the window, watching the street with that particular intensity she brought to everything.

'You made it,' she said, not looking up. 'I was starting to think you'd dissolved into that Hackney bubble of yours.'

'Traffic,' Tom lied. They both knew he'd walked.

Liv pushed a menu across the table. 'They do this thing with jollof rice and fried plantain that's going to change your life. Also, I have news.'

Tom raised an eyebrow. Liv's 'news' could mean anything from a new houseplant to a complete career pivot.

'I quit,' she said simply. 'Handed in my notice this morning.'

Tom set down the menu. The café buzzed around them—the hiss of the coffee machine, the clatter of plates, someone laughing at the counter. But in their corner, everything felt still.

'What are you going to do?'

Liv smiled, and it was the realest smile he'd seen from her in months. 'I have no idea. Isn't that terrifying? Isn't that wonderful?'

Tom thought about his own job, the songs he wrote in margins, the life he kept postponing. He thought about how easy it was to stay north of the river, in familiar streets, doing familiar things.

'Yeah,' he said finally. 'Yeah, it really is.'

The food arrived—rice the colour of sunset, plantain glistening with oil, a side of spicy pepper sauce. They ate in comfortable silence, watching Peckham pulse past the window.

Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is cross a river.
