Felix turned thirty-two in a restaurant in Soho that he couldn't quite afford, surrounded by people who made him feel like maybe that was okay.

Liv had organised everything—the reservation, the cake, the careful coordination of schedules. She was good at that, at making things happen without making it seem like effort.

'Speech!' Tom called, after the candles were blown out.

Felix stood, slightly awkward, holding a glass of wine he'd been nursing for an hour. 'I don't really do speeches.'

'Too bad,' Maya said. 'You're doing one now.'

He looked around at the faces watching him. These people who'd shown up on a Tuesday night, who'd pooled money for the cake, who'd remembered that he hated surprises so made sure to tell him in advance.

'When I was a kid,' he started, 'I thought being in your thirties meant having it all figured out. House, career, five-year plan. The whole thing.' He paused. 'I don't have any of that. But I have this. People who show up. And maybe that's the only plan that matters.'

'That was beautiful,' Liv said, wiping her eye dramatically.

'Shut up,' Felix laughed. 'Let me eat my cake.'

They stayed until the restaurant started putting chairs on tables, then spilled out onto the Soho streets, full of chocolate and wine and the particular warmth of being known.
