It wasn't supposed to become a tradition. Just four people who happened to be free on a Thursday night, meeting at a pub none of them had been to before.

Maya had suggested The Pineapple because it was halfway between everyone. Felix came straight from work, still in his agency uniform of expensive trainers and a shirt that cost more than it should. Liv arrived late, apologising, her portfolio bag knocking against the doorframe. And Tom was already there, nursing a pint in the corner.

'I don't think we've all been in the same room since that party,' Maya said, settling into the worn leather booth. 'What was that, March?'

'April,' Liv corrected. 'The one where someone set off the fire alarm.'

'That was me,' Tom admitted. 'Cigarette. I'm not proud.'

They ordered drinks and fell into conversation with the ease of people who'd once known each other well and were remembering why.

Felix talked about work, about the pitch that had gone wrong. Liv mentioned she was thinking of going freelance, said it quietly like she was testing how it sounded out loud. Maya admitted she'd started therapy, and nobody made it weird.

'We should do this again,' Liv said, as they were gathering coats.

'Next Thursday?' Maya suggested.

And just like that, without anyone deciding anything, it became a thing. The Silver Spooners were born.
