The N29 at 2am was its own kind of therapy. Liv had learned this over years of missed last tubes and questionable life choices.

Tonight, Maya was with her—both of them slightly drunk, definitely tired, sharing a bag of chips from the kebab shop on Camden High Street.

'Can I tell you something?' Maya said, her head resting against the window.

'Always.'

'I think I'm going to quit my job.'

Liv turned to look at her. Maya's job at the marketing firm was the thing everyone assumed she loved.

'Since when?'

'Since forever, maybe? I keep waiting to feel something about it. Passion, excitement, even just satisfaction. But it's just there. Like furniture.'

A fox trotted across the road outside, unbothered by the hour.

'Maybe not knowing is the first step to figuring it out,' Liv offered.

'That sounds like something from a self-help book.'

'It is. But it also feels true.'

Some conversations only happen at 2am. They're the ones that matter most.
