G was sitting across from Archie and a plate of bucatini all'Amatriciana when her boyfriend chose to continually dodge her question.

It seemed asking the man to see how he felt was the one thing he didn't check regularly.

'What are you doing tomorrow?' came his answer to 'How are you?'

My new Mary Jane toe itched on the floor, the sassy up-and-down beat of the toe preparing to start its drum.

There were two paths here: the argument and the interrogation of what was up with Archie — or the dessert menu.

'Seeing Birdie,' I replied simply, gesturing to the waiter.
