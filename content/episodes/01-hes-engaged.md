The clouds above looked like the jubilee line — grey and ready to break at any moment. Birdie hopped from one foot to the other aware that a downpour of rain would not be a way to welcome home her chocolate brown Dior. Flipping the clasp open she instinctively pulled her phone out and swiped to pass the time. B missed the one-legged pigeon fighting for a crust of sourdough and the homeless man playing on his iPhone. B missed the toddler conked out in his pram as the family strolled past and she nearly missed her best friend's arrival.

'Beatrice Aelfric, early! I never thought I'd see the day' Felicity Bhat tittered as they embraced.

'Engaged! He's engaged Flix! Have you seen this?' Birdie exchanged, holding up her phone like a wanted ad.

'No, but I want to see this' Flix cried snatching at her phone charm but continued dotingly 'You've not seen him since school B, and you dated him when you were 11'

'First loves deserve the acknowledgement they deserve' B giggled back 'I just couldn't be in a more different place'

'You've got to move in your own way, B. Maybe the future is sunny.' Flix coaxed, as the leggy friends steered each other in the direction of food.

It sounded like the topic of Baz and Birdie was coming up and Flix knew better than to manoeuvre that with a hangry best friend.
