The flat was quiet except for the hum of the fridge and the distant rumble of the Northern Line. Maya stood at the kitchen counter, watching steam curl from her mug of tea, thinking about last night.

She had met them all at The Pineapple—Liv, Felix, and Tom—their usual Thursday haunt in Kentish Town. What started as casual drinks had turned into one of those nights where conversations spiral deeper with each round.

Felix had finally admitted he was thinking of leaving his job at the agency. 'I'm thirty-two,' he'd said, swirling the ice in his glass. 'When did thirty-two start feeling so heavy?'

Liv had reached across the table and squeezed his hand. 'Heavy isn't bad. Heavy means it matters.'

Tom had stayed uncharacteristically quiet, nursing his pint. Maya knew that look—he was composing something in his head, probably lyrics he'd never share.

Now, in the grey morning light of her Hackney kitchen, Maya pulled out eggs and butter. There was something grounding about cooking after a night of big feelings. The ritual of it. Crack, whisk, pour.

Her phone buzzed. A message in their group chat: 'Brunch at mine? I'm making that sandwich.' It was from Liv.

That sandwich. The one they'd perfected over countless lazy Sundays. Sourdough, scrambled eggs, hot sauce, and—the secret ingredient—a thin layer of cream cheese that nobody expected but everyone loved.

Maya smiled and typed back: 'On my way.'

Because that's what they did, the Silver Spooners. They showed up. Through career crises and heartbreaks, through hangovers and breakthroughs. They showed up with sandwiches and stayed for the conversation.

And somehow, that was enough.
