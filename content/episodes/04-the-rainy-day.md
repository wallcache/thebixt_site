It had been raining for three days straight. The kind of grey, relentless London rain that made you question every life choice that led you to this city.

Liv was supposed to meet a client, but they'd cancelled. Tom's gig got postponed. Maya's plans fell through. So somehow, without anyone planning it, they all ended up at Felix's flat in Finsbury Park, dripping wet and slightly miserable.

'I'll make soup,' Felix said, because he didn't know what else to offer.

They sat in his small kitchen while he cooked—Maya perched on the counter, Liv scrolling through her phone, Tom staring out the window at the grey.

'Do you ever wonder if we're doing this wrong?' Tom asked suddenly.

'Doing what wrong?'

'Life. London. All of it. Everyone seems to have it figured out except us.'

Maya laughed. 'Nobody has it figured out. They're just better at pretending.'

The soup bubbled on the stove. Rain hammered against the windows. Felix tore bread into chunks and nobody said anything for a while, and that was okay.

'This is nice,' Liv said eventually. 'The accidental bit. Nobody having plans.'

'Best things usually are,' Felix replied.

They ate soup from mismatched bowls, dunking bread and talking about nothing. Outside, London kept being grey and wet and difficult. Inside, it didn't matter.
