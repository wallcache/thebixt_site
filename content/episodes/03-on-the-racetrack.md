Somewhere across London, the girls were still walking around the gallery drinking mojitos, as Baz stepped onto the racetrack.

Archie was standing in the crowd, looking towards the race, when Teddy fist-bumped his shoulder.

'This is new — gettof' came Archie, playfully pushing Teddy off his tee.

'Earth to Archie. I was talking about dating Molly — you know, _Molly_, the one you like me dating _not_ the Norwegian gymnast. And you didn't hear a thing. All ok mate!'

Archie nodded towards the cars lining up at the start line, dodging the question better than a Londoner swerving eye contact on the morning commute.

'Are you in a pickle, Archie? Should I be worried?' Teddy raised his eyebrows as Archie stayed transfixed on the engines starting 'Fighting with G about mangetout again?'

'No, no, we're fine.' Archie paused. 'I've been thinking —'

But then the zoom of an engine went past, and the glimpse of conversation disappeared in Baz's car dust. Their friend was set to be a front-runner in this race, and it seemed this race was going to be like all of Baz's others.
