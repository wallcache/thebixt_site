Maya's new flat was tiny, but it was hers. After three years of flatmates and compromises, she finally had a door she could close on the world.

The housewarming was modest—just the four of them, sitting on the floor because she hadn't bought a sofa yet. Fairy lights hung from hooks she'd spent an hour installing. A speaker played the playlist she'd made for the occasion.

'To Maya,' Felix said, raising his glass of sangria. 'And to spaces of our own.'

'It's so small,' Maya laughed. 'You could barely fit a cat in here.'

'But it's yours,' Liv said. 'That's the whole point.'

Tom looked around at the bare walls, the boxes still unpacked in the corner. 'What are you going to do with it?'

Maya thought about all the things she'd imagined. Reading nooks and dinner parties and Sunday mornings with nowhere to be. A life that looked like hers, finally.

'Everything,' she said. 'And nothing. That's the luxury, isn't it? Getting to decide.'

They stayed until midnight, talking about nothing important, making the empty space feel full.
