Broadway Market on a Sunday morning was Maya's church. The smell of fresh bread and coffee, the crush of people with canvas bags, the vendors calling out prices for tomatoes and flowers and sourdough loaves the size of your head.

She'd dragged Liv along today, promising pastries and people-watching. They walked slowly down the middle of the street, dodging cyclists and dogs and children eating crêpes.

'I don't understand how you do this every week,' Liv said, clutching her coffee like a lifeline. 'There are so many people.'

'That's the point.' Maya stopped at a vegetable stall, picking up a butternut squash and turning it over in her hands. 'It reminds you that you're part of something. That the city is alive.'

Liv raised an eyebrow. 'That's very philosophical for 10am.'

They bought apples from an orchard in Kent, cheese from a woman who knew every customer by name, and a jar of honey with honeycomb still floating inside. Maya's bag grew heavy. She didn't mind.

At the end of the market, they found a bench by the canal and sat watching the narrowboats drift past. Someone was playing guitar on one of them, the sound carrying across the water.

'I've been thinking about freelancing,' Liv said suddenly. 'Going out on my own. Leaving the agency.'

Maya looked at her—really looked. Liv was always the steady one, the one with the five-year plan and the sensible savings account. This felt significant.

'What would you do?'

'Branding. Packaging design. The stuff I actually love, not the client work that makes me want to scream into a pillow.' Liv laughed, but there was something fragile underneath it. 'Is that crazy?'

Maya thought about all the times she'd played it safe. The job she'd stayed in too long. The flat she'd been meaning to leave for two years. The life that looked perfect on paper but felt slightly too small.

'I think crazy is staying somewhere that makes you want to scream into a pillow.'

They sat there until the sun started to warm the bench, watching ducks fight over bread someone had thrown. The guitar on the narrowboat switched to a song they both knew.

'Same time next week?' Liv asked as they gathered their bags.

'Always.'

Maya walked home through London Fields, the weight of her market haul grounding her. Tonight she'd roast that squash. Tomorrow she'd start looking for a new flat. Small steps. Sunday steps.
